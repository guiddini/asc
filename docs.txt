Usage
Scrollable CalendarStrip — New in 2.x
The scrollable prop was introduced in 2.0.0 and features a bi-directional infinite scroller. It recycles days using RecyclerListView, shifting the dates as the ends are reached. The Chrome debugger can cause issues with this updating due to a RN setTimeout bug. To prevent date shifts at the ends of the scroller, set the minDate and maxDate range to a year or less.

The refactor to support scrollable introduced internal changes to the CalendarDay component. Users of the dayComponent prop may need to adjust their custom day component to accommodate the props passed to it.

Prop	Description
getSelectedDate()	Returns the currently selected date. If no date is selected, returns undefined.
setSelectedDate(date)	Sets the selected date. date may be a Moment object, ISO8601 date string, or any format that Moment is able to parse. It is the responsibility of the caller to select a date that makes sense (e.g. within the current week view).

config	The config object holding all of the localization strings..	Object
Build Release info
To properly make a release build, import the appropriate "Locale" module using the following steps. Not importing the locale module will crash the release build (though the dev build will work).

1- import momentJs module:

$ yarn add moment

or

$ npm install moment

2- Go to your index.js and import the specific "Locale" after the main moment import. Ex:

import 'moment';
import 'moment/locale/fr';  // language must match config
import moment from 'moment-timezone';  // only if timezone is needed
The locale import must match the language specified in the locale config (example below).

Example of one locale object is:

Device Specific Notes
OnePlus devices use OnePlus Slate font by default which causes text being cut off in the date number in react-native-calendar-strip. To overcome this change the default font of the device or use a specific font throughout your app.
Development with Sample Application
To facilitate development, the example directory has a sample app.

cd example
npm run cp
npm install
npm start
The CalendarStrip source files are copied from the project root directory into example/CalendarStrip using npm run cp. If a source file is modified, it must be copied over again with npm run cp.
